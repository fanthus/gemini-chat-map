# Gemini Chat Map

**Gemini Chat Map** is a productivity extension designed for the Google Gemini chat interface. It helps users quickly locate any historical message within long conversations.

By generating a **“Conversation Map”** in the Gemini sidebar, the extension automatically extracts key information from each user prompt and presents it as a clear list or outline. With a single click on any item in the sidebar, users can instantly jump to the corresponding part of the conversation—no more endless scrolling.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Conversation Outline**  
  Automatically generates concise titles based on each user query, forming a navigable outline of the current conversation.

- **One-Click Navigation to History**  
  Click any item in the outline to jump directly to that message in the conversation, ideal for reviewing and comparing answers in long chats.

- **Real-Time Updates**  
  As you continue chatting with Gemini in the same session, new prompts are automatically appended to the outline, keeping the navigation fully in sync.

- **Lightweight & Non-Intrusive**  
  All functionality lives in the sidebar and does not modify Gemini’s original interface or interaction flow.

## Use Cases

Gemini Chat Map is especially useful for, but not limited to:
- System design discussions  
- Code reviews  
- Multi-round solution comparisons  
- Study notes and knowledge organization
